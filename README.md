# Mazwällaitösp - Yet Another Revision of This Language

Mazwällaitösp/Maţřëullaitösp is yet another community [TNIL](https://ithkuil.net/) revision/expansion project. It is at the moment a collection of ideas about extending and improving the language for the purposes of being more flexible, more intuitive, and more useable

## Roadmap
### Brainstorm
* Root additions
	* Yarn
		* Crochet. Knitting
		* Friendship bracelets
	* Carrier 2
		* Brand names
		* Abbreviations?
	* Technology
		* Użkw: voice over internet; voice calls
		* Website
		* ~~Personal computer~~
		* ~~Mobile phone~~
		* Computer components
		* User interface, window, tab, menu, dialogue, text box/text field
		* Parts of a book. Covers, binding 
		* ? iPhone, Android, Windows, Linux, BSD, Solaris - just use carrier?
	* Misc
		* To miss something (e.g. miss the bus, miss the meeting)
			* https://discord.com/channels/131937038139260928/509906677210808340/1351970735135916062
* Context additions
	* “Name”
* Misc
	* Acronym support
	* ![[-Resources/Attachments/Pasted image 20250603230326.png]]
* Script
	* Indication of shortcut
	* Affixual transcription 
	* More systematic diacritics
	* More pretty hand written styles
	* 
* Affix additions
	* Negation of capacitive and obligative modalities (more aversive style shortcuts)
* Ambiguities/Shortcomings
	* Case frames (linguistic definition) should be specified for verbs. Cases should be more concrete and less ambiguous. Like toaq.
	* Vv-Cr-Vr (Stem-Root-Specification)
		* Amrizêi (cause many deaths or the many causes of one death?)
		* No way to modify root+stem before the specification (modify any of the concepts within the root-stem-specification gestalt)
	* Friendship (reciprocal) but "friend"
	* ~~Applying Ca information to a Ca.~~
	* Extension can be spatial or temporal regardless of nominal or verbal status
	* Composable bias adjuncts (affixes/roots)...maybe w & y for stem 2/3
	* Independent affixes (no formative attached)
	* All affixes correspond to roots via their letters. Same with bias adjuncts
* Additions
	* Phonology
		* Ejectives, q/hh(7)
	* Valences2 (7/hh)
		* Make someone do something
		* Be made to do something
	* Affixes scoped over whole sentence
	* Affixes scope on aspect but not validation 
	* Biases
		* 'ugh' (I don't wanna / I feel so meh)
		* reluctant acceptance
		* yes & no
		* Sadness
		* Disappointment 
		* ~~Oww (this might exist)~~
		* Fuck!
		* Prettyyyy
		* Awwe (sad, cute)
		* Cute!!
* Modifications
	* Sonorous/shoutable biases
