# Mazwällaitösp - Yet Another Revision of This Language

Mazwällaitösp/Maţřëullaitösp is yet another community [TNIL](https://ithkuil.net/) revision/expansion project. It is at the moment a collection of ideas about extending and improving the language for the purposes of being more flexible, more intuitive, and more useable

_The description suggestions that there have been other ‘revisions’ of TNIL but I do not believe this to be the case. I believe the other projects are their own languages inspiration from TNIL. An update to the name and description of this project may be warranted_

## Changes
## Roadmap
The following is brainstorming and thus is of varying degrees of quality, accuracy, relevance, etc
### Phonology
* Additions such as
	* Ejectives
	* q/hh(7) (as in arabic & ithkuil 3)
### Basic Morphology
* Context additions
	* context for proper name
### Verbal Morphology
* Additions
	* Valences2 (7/hh)
		* Make someone do something//causative
		* Be made to do something//causative+passive voice
### Roots
* Additions
	* Yarn
		* Crochet. Knitting
		* Friendship bracelets
	* Carrier 2
		* Brand names
		* Abbreviations & Acronyms?
	* Technology
		* Użkw: voice over internet; voice calls
		* Website
		* Computer components
			* PSU, CPU, RAM, NVME, SSD, HDD, SATA, I2C, Serial, USB, GPU, Network Card, &e
		* User interface, window, tab, menu, dialogue, text box/text field
		* Parts of a book. Covers, binding 
		* ? iPhone, Android, Windows, Linux, BSD, Solaris - just use carrier?
	* Misc
		* “information”
### Script
* Indication of shortcut
* Affixual transcription 
* More systematic diacritics
* More pretty hand written styles
### VxCs 
* Affix additions
	* Negation of capacitive and obligative modalities (more aversive style shortcuts)
- Modifications
	* Affixes scoped over whole sentence
	* Affixes scope on aspect but not validation? Moveable aspect slot?
### Biases
* Additions
	* 'ugh' (I don't wanna / I feel so meh)
	* reluctant acceptance
	* yes & no
	* acquiescence (alright I’ll do it // I agree)
		* don’t overlap with approbative
	* Sadness
	* Disappointment 
	* Oww (for emotional pain)
	* Yay!
	* Emphasis (!!)
	* Excitement
	* Aww (empathy)
	* Teasingness and/or playfulness
	* Gentleness/Tenderness
	* Fuck! (same as exasperative perhaps?)
	* Prettyyyy
	* Awwe (sad, cute)
	* Cute!!
* Modifications
	* Sonorous/shoutable biases
### Misc
- way to indicate usage of special, conventionalized meaning? Perhaps through ‘context’
- ![[-Resources/Attachments/Pasted image 20250603230326.png]]
* Ambiguities/Shortcomings
	* Case frames (linguistic definition) should be specified for verbs. Cases should be more concrete and less ambiguous. Like toaq.
	* Vv-Cr-Vr (Stem-Root-Specification)
		* Amrizêi (cause many deaths or the many causes of one death?)
		* No way to modify root+stem before the specification (modify any of the concepts within the root-stem-specification gestalt)
	* Friendship (reciprocal) but "friend"
	* ~~Applying Ca information to a Ca.~~
	* Extension can be spatial or temporal regardless of nominal or verbal status
	* Composable bias adjuncts (affixes/roots)...maybe w & y for stem 2/3
	* Independent affixes (no formative attached)
	* All affixes correspond to roots via their letters. Same with bias adjuncts
* More referential omission modes & affixes
